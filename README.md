# Masita

A Neovim colorscheme written fully in `lua` based on my previous colorscheme `nordokai` which was originally inspired by on [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/vscode)'s project and the [Nord](https://nordtheme.com) color palette.

This scheme takes inspiration from the well written [Catpuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim) colorscheme for neovim.
